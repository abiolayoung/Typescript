[✔] mitigation strategy - Add if check to function validate and sanitize user input
    typescript is a tool that help developer write better and less error prone code

                        **WHAT TYPESCRIPT ADDS**
[✔] typescript adds types to our jscode in order to be way more explicit about how our code works
[✔] we can use next-gen features witihin our ts file(compiled down for old browser) 
[✔] typescript also adds non-javascript features like interfaces or generics 
    (these are features that gives us clear errors and helps us await more errors)
[✔] it also gives us meta programming features like decorator
[✔] it is also highly configurable (rich configuration options)
[✔] it provides modern tooling that helps in non typescript projects

         **WORKING WITH TYPES (Core Syntax & Features)***
*using types - core TYPES
[✔] number type e.g (1, 5.3, -10) - (positive, decimal, and negative number)
[✔] string type e.g ('Hi', "Hi", `Hi`) - (all text value, string quoting are accepted with typescript)
[✔] Boolean type e.g (true, false) -(just these 2, no "truthy" or "falsy" values)
[✔] Object type- any javascript object, more specific  types (type of object) are possible
[✔] Arrays Type - any data can be stored in an array [1, 2, 3]
[✔] Tuple Type - javascript does not have tuple, [1, 2] -this is a fixed length and type array
[✔] Enum Type - javascript doesnt understand the enum type, enum{NEW, OLD}- added by typescript
   this automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
[✔] Union Type - this is the combinator of 2 data types using the OR operator when declaring the type
[✔] Literal Types- this type is especially used when used in conjunction with union types
[✔] Unknown type - the type unkown is used when we dont know what the user will parse in
    the unknown type is not assignable to any other type
[✔] the never type- never is a type that return void, it never returns anything



* typescript's type system only helps us during development (i.e before the code gets compiled)
* only typescript understand a column after a variable, js doesnt understand that
* an error will always be shown if you try to assign a value other than the declared data type

* in declaringa typescript object, we can eiher declare the varible as object my writing object
  or by declaring a curly braces in replacement of the object text
* typescript describe an array of string data as string[], and any[] - to accept any form of data in the array

*type alliases - this is used to repeat a union type- we declare with any name that js or ts doesnt recognize
this is when you declare a union type in a variable using the type keyword then assign the varible to the data type declaration
it doesnt just accept number and string e.g (string | number) but also accept any declaration with the value using the OR operator
it can be used to create our own custom type

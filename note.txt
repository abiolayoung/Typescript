[✔] mitigation strategy - Add if check to function validate and sanitize user input
    typescript is a tool that help developer write better and less error prone code

                        **WHAT TYPESCRIPT ADDS**
[✔] typescript adds types to our jscode in order to be way more explicit about how our code works
[✔] we can use next-gen features witihin our ts file(compiled down for old browser) 
[✔] typescript also adds non-javascript features like interfaces or generics 
    (these are features that gives us clear errors and helps us await more errors)
[✔] it also gives us meta programming features like decorator
[✔] it is also highly configurable (rich configuration options)
[✔] it provides modern tooling that helps in non typescript projects

         **WORKING WITH TYPES (Core Syntax & Features)***
*using types - core TYPES
[✔] number type e.g (1, 5.3, -10) - (positive, decimal, and negative number)
[✔] string type e.g ('Hi', "Hi", `Hi`) - (all text value, string quoting are accepted with typescript)
[✔] Boolean type e.g (true, false) -(just these 2, no "truthy" or "falsy" values)

* typescript's type system only helps us during development (i.e before the code gets compiled)
* only typescript understand a column after a variable, js doesnt understand that
* an error will always be shown if you try to assign a value other than the declared data type
